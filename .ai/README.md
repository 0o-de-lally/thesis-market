# .ai Directory

This directory contains operational assets and configurations that are consumed by AI agents during their work. While `docs/agents` defines *who* the agents are, this directory provides the tools and context they *use*.

## Contents

- **/prompts**: Reusable prompt templates for common tasks (e.g., `generate_test_cases.md`).
- **/context**: Important context files for agents to reference (e.g., `coding_style_guide.md`).
- **/tools**: Specialized scripts used exclusively by agents.
- **/configs**: Configuration files for AI-specific services or frameworks.
