## Strategic Philosophy

Open Libra is a different kind of blockchain. We prioritize the long game. The blockchain exists for the asset $LBR and to make it a valuable asset into perpetuity. As such we don't plan to fight the typical L1 battle, to become a world computer. Instead we include apps and features and games which improve the probability of $LBR compounding into perpetuity.

## 1. Problem Statement

The current blockchain landscape is dominated by general-purpose L1s competing to become "world computers," leading to:
- Diluted focus and resources across infinite use cases
- Short-term speculation rather than long-term value creation
- Unsustainable tokenomics that don't prioritize asset appreciation over time
- Ecosystems that prioritize transaction volume over asset quality and longevity

We solve this by creating a blockchain specifically designed around one core objective: making $LBR a valuable asset that compounds into perpetuity.
