## Open Libra Strategic Philosophy

Open Libra is a different kind of blockchain. We prioritize the long game. The blockchain exists for the asset $LBR and to make it a valuable asset into perpetuity. As such we don't plan to fight the typical L1 battle, to become a world computer. Instead we include apps and features and games which improve the probability of $LBR compounding into perpetuity.

## Thesis-Market: A Curated Prediction Market for Megatrends

**TLDR:** Thesis-Market is a prediction market application on Open Libra, curated to include markets for megatrends in business and society.

Over time, prediction markets help surface private information and reveal experts. Open Libra can create markets for long-term themes such as:
- Economic progress
- AI adoption
- Medical advances
- Other impactful societal trends

This product is useful for anyone who wants to participate in broad and impactful themes, when there are no assets that perfectly capture those themes. For Open Libra, it creates a venue which could attract deep thinking researchers.

## Problem Statement

**Blockchain Ecosystem Problem:**
The current blockchain landscape is dominated by general-purpose L1s competing to become "world computers," leading to:
- Diluted focus and resources across infinite use cases
- Short-term speculation rather than long-term value creation
- Unsustainable tokenomics that don't prioritize asset appreciation over time
- Ecosystems that prioritize transaction volume over asset quality and longevity

**Recruitment & Incentives Problem (OL and industry-wide):**
- Free mining in OL attracted opportunistic participants who casually ran simple software for outsized gains, with low conversion into active, useful contributors.
- Steady-state validator rewards tend to recruit mercenary operators. OL intentionally prefers low rewards to network operators, further reducing this mercenary attractant.
- Net effect: there is no strong attractant for deep-thinking people engaged with forward-looking themes to join and stay active in the ecosystem.

**Prediction Market Problem:**
Existing prediction markets lack curation and focus on short-term events rather than long-term megatrends. There's no venue for deep thinkers and researchers to participate in markets about society's most important long-term themes.

**Implication:**
Without a Schelling point and purpose-built incentive design for high-signal contributors, OL will under-recruit the human capital needed to compound $LBR value over long horizons.

**Solution:** Thesis-Market on Open Libra creates a curated prediction market focused on megatrends, attracting thoughtful participants while contributing to $LBR's long-term value through meaningful economic activity and expert knowledge aggregation. With purpose-built rewards and incentives, Thesis-Market can become OL's Schelling point for people who can "see around corners."

## OL Meta-Endowment Structure (Donor-Voice Accounts)

OL operates "donor-voice-accounts" as perpetual endowments that donors can monitor over time. In the medium term, OL must identify and onboard qualified investment managers for these endowments so that, in the long run, the collective capital is allocated to sensible, forward-looking, high-impact opportunities aligned with OL themes and $LBR value.

Implications:
- The business strategy is simple, but today’s primary constraint is recruiting: we historically attracted casual infrastructure "miners," not visionary thinkers and disciplined managers.
- Thesis-Market can serve as a discovery funnel for high-signal contributors whose demonstrated foresight (over megatrend markets) can inform manager recruitment and mandate design.

## Talent Attraction & Sub-DAO Manager Funnel

Purpose: Convert high-signal, lateral-thinking forecasters into candidates to steward donor-voice endowment sub-DAOs.

Why a curated prediction market attracts them:
- Cognitive Challenge Density: Carefully scoped, high-ambiguity, cross-domain megatrend markets create an intellectual arena that rewards synthesis over rote pattern chasing.
- Reputation as Portable Capital: A transparent, cryptographically timestamped forecast + reasoning trail acts as a public performance dossier more credible than self-reported credentials.
- Non-Commodity Incentives: Delayed, reputation-weighted payouts plus access to invitation-only long-horizon markets appeal to intrinsically motivated, status-sensitive thinkers rather than extractive mercenaries.
- Narrative Surface Area: Commentary threads and thesis articulation allow unconventional frameworks (second-order effects, systems thinking) to be surfaced and evaluated.
- Anti-Noise Curation: By excluding trivial/short-horizon hype markets, signal density stays high—this reduces opportunity cost for serious thinkers.

Signals that map to sub-DAO manager potential:
- Cross-Domain Correlation: Consistent above-median calibration across at least 3 distinct thematic clusters (e.g., AI, macro, bio).
- Thesis Quality Metrics: Peer-reviewed reasoning notes scoring high on clarity, falsifiability, and alternative scenario enumeration.
- Adversarial Robustness: Low degradation of forecast accuracy when confronted with stress-test prompts or counter-theses.
- Time-to-Revision Discipline: Timely Bayesian updates following new public information; penalize anchoring inertia.
- Portfolio Construction Proxy: Simulated capital allocation game (shadow portfolio) fed by their probability distributions vs realized outcomes.

Funnel Stages:
1. Open Screening Layer: Broad megatrend micro-questions (1–6 month horizon) to collect baseline calibration & reasoning samples.
2. Performance Triage: Automated scoring (Brier/log), variance normalization, cluster analysis to identify multi-domain strength.
3. Invite Cohort (Long-Horizon Track): Access to 5–10 year structured markets with mandatory thesis write-ups & scenario trees.
4. Shadow Mandate Simulation: Candidates manage a paper endowment allocation informed by their forecasts; tracked on risk-adjusted return proxies (information ratio analog using forecast deltas → simulated positions).
5. Governance Evaluation: Lightweight interviews + peer review of risk management memos and steward principles.
6. Sub-DAO Nomination: Top performers graduate to on-chain signaling vote for provisional manager roles with staged capital unlock.

Incentive & Safeguard Design:
- Reputation Staking: Managers bond a portion of accrued reputation tokens, slashable for misconduct (misreporting, manipulation attempts).
- Dual Layer Rewards: (a) Forecast accuracy & reasoning quality, (b) Shadow mandate performance alignment with declared risk policy.
- Collusion Resistance: Market curation + anomaly detection on correlated improbable forecast shifts; mandatory disclosure of external conflicts.

Key Metrics (Manager Funnel):
- High-signal forecasters discovered per quarter (target v1: 50; manager-track candidates: 5–10).
- Cross-domain calibration stability (std dev of Brier across clusters).
- Shadow mandate tracking error vs benchmark thematic indices.
- Conversion rate: Invite Cohort → Manager Nomination.

Next Actions (Handoffs):
- Market Intelligence: Define thematic cluster taxonomy & baseline benchmarks for cross-domain calibration analysis.
- Technical Architect: Specify data model for forecast → shadow portfolio transformation & reputation staking mechanism.
- Product Strategy: Draft manager qualification rubric & publish evaluation transparency guidelines.

## Assumptions & Evidence Status
- Prediction markets can reliably surface private information and identify expert forecasters over long horizons. [Assumption → Market Intelligence to validate]
- Curated, theme-based markets will attract deep-thinking researchers more than open, short-term event markets. [Assumption → Market Intelligence to test with interviews/history]
- Purpose-built incentives (e.g., long-horizon payouts, reputation staking) will attract and retain high-signal contributors without creating mercenary behavior. [Assumption → Design + MI to prototype/test]
- Prediction-market track records can be a useful proxy signal for evaluating potential investment managers for donor-voice endowments. [Assumption → Market Intelligence to review literature/precedents]

## Strategic Guardrails (for agents)
- Do not optimize for generalized L1 adoption; prioritize $LBR value alignment and curated markets.
- Avoid incentive designs that reward pure volume or short-term activity; prefer long-horizon accuracy and calibration.
- Maintain high signal-to-noise: strict market curation around megatrends; resist event-churn.
- Keep operator rewards modest; channel surplus incentives to forecasters/researchers who add durable signal.

## Stage Gates (next 2 checkpoints)
1) Problem validation brief approved (Market Intelligence): evidence pack on curated megatrends markets, user ICP, historical efficacy of long-horizon prediction markets. Acceptance: 5+ citations, interview notes, risk assessment.
2) Incentive design v0 (Product/Tech): draft mechanisms and economic model (payout curves, reputation, anti-gaming). Acceptance: feasibility note from Technical Architect; basic cost-to-serve estimate.

## Handoffs
- To Market Intelligence: develop evidence pack for assumptions above; propose initial megatrend categories and example markets.
- To Technical Architect: outline minimal architecture for curated markets, reputation ledger, payout scheduling, and anti-Sybil controls; note constraints from low validator rewards.
- To Market Intelligence (endowments): scan for qualified impact/forward-looking investment managers and define evaluation criteria; assess whether prediction-market performance correlates with investment decision quality.
