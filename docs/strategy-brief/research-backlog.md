## Assumption Mapping
A1 Long-horizon forecasting surfaces private info  
A2 Curation attracts deeper thinkers  
A3 Incentive timing improves depth  
A4 Calibration+reasoning predicts governance  
A5 Forecast performance proxies allocation skill  
A6 Shadow mandate fidelity  
A7 Commentary adds selection precision  
A8 (Merged into A3/B8)  
A15/16 Long-horizon appetite & interim proxy tolerance  
A17 Domain distinctiveness  
A18 Reasoning scoring reliability  
A19 Update latency utility  
A20 Normalization robustness  
B8 Delayed payouts vs liquidity  
B9 Reputation staking deterrence  
B10 Anti-gaming sufficiency  
C11 Low-reward validator security (handled outside market scope)  
C12 Governance integration risk  
C13 Curated narrative asset durability perception  
C14 Donor-voice manager funnel feasibility  

C11 & C14 will require cross-team collaboration; create separate technical or economic memos when entering SCOPING.

## Next 7-Day Focus (Proposed)
1. Draft spec for R1 (data schema + baseline definition).  
2. Draft rubric v0 for R2 (dimensions: clarity, falsifiability, scenario coverage, evidence use, responsiveness).  
3. Experimental design doc for R3 (participant assignment, power estimate).
