## Thesis-Market Press & Stakeholder Release

**Remote - 2025-08-13**

Open Libra today announced Thesis-Market, a curated, multi horizon prediction market that converts forecasting accuracy into a visible, portable reputation signal. It is built for researchers, analysts, prospective donor voice endowment stewards, and aligned donors who need proof of judgment, not noise.

"I wanted a venue that rewards clear, testable long term theses instead of hot takes. Thesis-Market finally channels deep research into a portable track record," said Elena M., Independent Macro Researcher.

### Why Now

Serious forecasting demand is proven:
* Polymarket - surging retail participation
* Kalshi - CFTC approved event contracts
* Good Judgment Project - accuracy gains in curated superforecaster cohorts
* Metaculus - aggregation plus reasoning culture improves signal quality

Thesis-Market brings these mechanics together for the missing piece: a purpose built long horizon venue that doubles as a talent discovery tool for governance and donor capital allocation.

### How It Works

Participants make probabilistic forecasts across three horizons:
* Fast Calibration - quick questions for instant feedback
* Milestone Markets - medium term thematic checkpoints
* Megatrend Theses - years long forecasts on high impact trends

Forecasts are timestamped, scored (Brier and log metrics), and stored with reasoning notes to build a transparent dossier of foresight quality.

Example: A forecaster predicts global AI model training costs will drop 80% by 2030. Short term GPU price markets and medium term model scale checkpoints track progress, while the 2030 megatrend market resolves the thesis and produces a verified performance record.

## Key Features
* Curated Megatrends - Only high impact, clearly resolvable themes (AI adoption, bio progress, energy transitions)
* Multi Horizon Ladder - Short, medium, and long term markets connect early calibration to final outcomes
* Transparent Reputation Ledger - Timestamped forecasts with public reasoning build credibility
* Shadow Mandate Simulation - Forecast distributions map to a simulated thematic allocation for governance insight
* Delayed, Reputation Weighted Payouts - Rewards favor consistent accuracy over quick churn
* Community Wallet Bounties - Sponsored prize pools amplify returns for top performers
* Compliance First Access - Geo fencing, attestation, and anomaly detection reduce early regulatory risk

## Availability
* Private design validation - in progress now
* Limited alpha (Q4 2025) - six pilot megatrend markets, invite based
* Waitlist open today - repository updates will announce access steps

# FAQ

## For Customers

**How does Thesis-Market work?**
Post probability forecasts across short, medium, and long horizons. The system scores them and tracks update discipline plus reasoning. Top performers join invite only long horizon cohorts and the shadow mandate simulation.

**Who is it for?**
Forecasters, researchers in AI, bio, energy, macro, impact donors seeking talent signals, and prospective governance stewards.

**How much does it cost?**
Early participation is free (plus network fees). Profits from correct forecasts and community funded bounties are possible. Some later features may require staking or bonded reputation.

**How do payouts work?**
Markets resolve and settle positions. Incentives may be delayed and weighted by reputation. Bounties and prizes distribute after audit.

## For Internal Stakeholders

**Biggest Risk**
Low early participant quality, mitigated via calibration layer, invite funnel, and delayed payout incentives.

**Strategic Fit**
Creates a Schelling point to identify high signal thinkers for donor capital stewardship, aligning with long term $LBR value.

**Resources for v0**
1 product lead, 1 technical architect, 2 full stack engineers, fractional compliance counsel, and market intelligence support for question sourcing.

**Initial KPIs**
* 1,000 screening participants
* 50 high signal forecasters across domains
* 70% retention over 3 months for invite cohort
* Reduced churn versus flat payouts (revision cadence)

**Open Assumptions**
Shadow mandate validity, cross domain calibration transfer, and optimal payout delay and weight parameters (tracked in `research-backlog.md`).

*Important Information:* Future features (for example, direct donor voice endowment integration) are aspirational pending verification and compliance review. No unverified operational claims are asserted.
